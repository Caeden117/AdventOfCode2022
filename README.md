# AdventOfCode2022

This repository contains my personal solutions to Advent of Code 2022. The code in this repository is not my best work; there are no attempts to optimize this code for performance or readability.

## Languages

For most days, the solutions will be written in C# with .NET 7. However, if I am interested enough, I will use a different language.
