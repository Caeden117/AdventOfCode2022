# AdventOfCode2022

This repository contains my personal solutions to Advent of Code 2022.

The code in this repository will not be not my best work; there are no attempts to optimize this code for performance or readability. I am simply interested in writing solutions to these problems.


## Languages

For most days, the solutions will be written in C# with .NET 7. However, if I am interested enough, I will use a different language.

I am not imposing any challenges on myself regarding the language I use, what tools are available to me, or what libraries I can use.
